# Database of XPS corelevels

## Description
This Project offers a quick access to the XPS core levels of any atoms via an interactive web-based page. The used database is derived from the <a>"\href https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Ray-Photoelectron-Spectroscopy-624755/dp/0962702625"target="_blank">MAHMOUDI_EN.pdf</a> 

## Installation
To run the GUI, I recommend setting up a Python virtual environment (tested and verified under the 3.8.0 version) and adding the required libraries using the following command after cloning the rep (you can just download the rep in case you don't use git):
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
You have just to follow the link: https://aymen-mahmoudi.github.io/Corelevels/
<br>
Add the atomic number or the atom symbol, choose the source, and press the buton to show the corresponding reference XPS curve.
